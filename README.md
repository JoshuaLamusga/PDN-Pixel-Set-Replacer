# Pixel Set Replacer
This is a plugin for Paint.NET that replaces all segments of one image with equally-sized segments of another image.

**Store Image to Replace**: Stores the first image, which should be replaced.  

**Store Replacing Image**: Stores the second image, which must be the same size as the first and will replace all copies of it.  

**Tolerance**: How much each pixel is allowed to deviate from the image to replace. Used mostly on lossy-formatted images.

**Reset**: Discards the stored images.

**Replace**: Replaces all copies of the first image with the second. It may take awhile.
